# DeFi-Exchange

The idea of a decentralized exchange is simple - allow users to trade their crypto directly on-chain through smart contracts without giving up control of their private keys.

While it sounds simple, the reality is much more complicated. In short, decentralized exchanges are a beautiful piece of mathematics and software combined together. We hope by the end of this article you will share the same feeling.

The birth of modern decentralized exchanges was primarily led by Uniswap. Not only is Uniswap the leading decentralized exchange on Ethereum, it is THE leading dApp on Ethereum in general.

After Vitalik Buterin posted a blog post on Path Independence in 2017, Hayden Adams was inspired to try to implement Vitalik's ideas in what eventually became Uniswap.

After spending over a year working on the code, Hayden finally announced and launched Uniswap in November 2018
